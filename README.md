**Scenario: Emily's Financial Awakening**

Emily, a 28-year-old graphic designer, has always been creative with her designs but not so much with her finances. Recently, she landed a couple of big clients, significantly boosting her income. With this sudden increase, Emily finds herself unsure about managing her new financial situation effectively.

One evening, while discussing her challenges over coffee with a friend, her friend mentions Jung Bank. Intrigued, Emily visits your bank’s website and discovers the Jung Bank resources. These tools promises not only to track expenses and incomes but to also **understand**.

Let's take a look at a real-life consultation from Emily and the CEO Agatha Jung.

**Emily: Hi Agatha, I'm really excited about joining Jung Bank, but I'm not sure where to start. What’s the first thing I should do after I log in?**

Agatha: Here let me show you!

The layout is really simple yet functionable. You can make deposits, payments, or take a look at your ledger.

**Emily: That sounds great. Can the app help me keep track of my spending for different categories like groceries or entertainment?**

Agatha: Yes we have a built-in file that records every transaction that you made! When prompted to input a deposit or payment, you'll be asked to input the product description and amount.

After completing a transaction, it will be recorded like so:

**Emily: Okay wow! I love the simplicity of this application. BUt, tell me, what does the ledger do?**

Agatha: The ledger displays the transactions you made, and it breaks it down even further in the reports option. Let's go through it together.

The first option is quite obvious, so let's skip that and head into the deposit page.

All deposits you did will show up here.

All payments made will be shown here.

If you want to see an even more detailed report, we broke it up into different times as well.

![month2Date](/images/month2Date.png)

This one shows all transactions in this month. Similarly, you can also see transactions for the previous month too like this:

**Emily: That’s very handy! Last question, what if I want to search up a transaction made at a certain place?**

Agatha: We implemented a search option as well. So if you ever want to know how much you spent at Sephora, for example, just type it in and voila!

**Emily: Thank you, Agatha! I NEEDED this! I am confident that my expenditures will be more accurate and wise.**

Agatha: Thank you Emily... you are the only customer : , ) ... for now.
