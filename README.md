**Scenario: Emily's Financial Awakening**

Emily, a 28-year-old graphic designer, has always been creative with her designs but not so much with her finances. Recently, she landed a couple of big clients, significantly boosting her income. With this sudden increase, Emily finds herself unsure about managing her new financial situation effectively.

One evening, while discussing her challenges over coffee with a friend, her friend mentions Jung Bank. Intrigued, Emily visits your bank’s website and discovers the Jung Bank resources. These tools promises not only to track expenses and incomes but to also **understand**.

Let's take a look at a real-life consultation from Emily and the CEO Agatha Jung.

**Emily: Hi Agatha, I'm really excited about joining Jung Bank, but I'm not sure where to start. What’s the first thing I should do after I log in?**

Agatha: Here let me show you!

The layout is really simple yet functionable. You can make deposits, payments, or take a look at your ledger.

**Emily: That sounds great. Can the app help me keep track of my spending for different categories like groceries or entertainment?**

Agatha: Yes we have a built-in file that records every transaction that you made! When prompted to input a deposit or payment, you'll be asked to input the product description and amount.
